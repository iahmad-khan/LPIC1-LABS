1.  In user's home directory, create a text file with any content called testfile.txt. You may use any method you choose to create this file.

 

    Possible Solutions:

    echo "testing" > testfile.txt

    touch testfile.txt

 

2.  Make a copy of the recently created testfile.txt into a file called mytest.txt using any method you would like. Using the appropriate privileges, move that file to the /etc directory.

 

    Possible Solutions:

    cp testfile.txt mytest.txt && sudo mv mytest.txt /etc

    (NOTE: you can execute that command on one line or in subsequent lines)

    sudo cp testfile.txt /etc/mytest.txt

 

3.  Make sure you are in your user home directory. Execute a find command to display the location of the testfile.txt text file created in Step #1. Execute the same command but specify that the search should begin with the /home directory and note the results.

 

    find -name testfile.txt

    testfile.txt

    find /home -name testfile.txt

    find: /home/testusers: Permission Denied (any accounts in /home not owned by user)
    /home/user/testfile.txt

 

4.  As the user user, execute a find command with the appropriate options to display the location of the file called mytest.txt. Start the search from the root (i.e. /) directory. Re-execute that command as the root user or with sudo privileges and note the results.

 

    find / -name mytest.txt

    [Permission Denied messages], no file found

    sudo find / -name mytest.txt

    /etc/mytest.txt

 

5.  Using appropriate privileges, copy the /etc/mytest.txt file to /etc/myTesT.txt. Execute a find command on that name that will show the results of both files (i.e. ignore the case in the filenames).

 

    sudo cp /etc/mytest.txt /etc/myTesT.txt
    sudo find / -iname mytest.txt

    /etc/myTesT.txt
    /etc/mytest.txt

 

6.  As the root user or executing the command with sudo privileges, find all files on the system that end with .txt, paginate the results so you can scroll through them.

 

    sudo find / -name "*.txt" | more

    [A lot of results should appear as there are a lot of text files on any Linux system]

 

7.  Using the find command, change the permissions on the /etc/myTesT.txt file so that it is universal read/write/execute. This should be done in one line using the find command options only.

 

    sudo find / -name myTesT.txt -exec chmod 777 {} \;
    sudo ls -al /etc/myTest.txt

    -rwxrwxrwx 1 root root 8 Aug  2 17:00 /etc/myTesT.txt

 

8.  With the find command, using root or sudo privileges, display all executable files in /usr directory.

 

    sudo find /usr -perm /a=x

    [A number of directories and files in /usr that should have executable permissions will list here]

 

9.  Run the updatedb command to update your filesystem name database using appropriate root or sudo privileges. Use the locate command to find all three files you created in Steps 1, 2 and 5.

 

    updatedb
    locate testfile.txt

    /home/user/testfile.txt

    locate mytest.txt

    /etc/mytest.txt

    locate myTesT.txt

    /etc/myTesT.txt
