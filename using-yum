4.  Using the tool from Step #3, execute the command with the appropriate options to DOWNLOAD (but not install) the 'nano' package. Once downloaded, use the standard package management command as in Steps #1 and #2 to install the downloaded package.

    user@linuxacademy:~$ sudo yumdownloader nano

    user@linuxacademy:~$ ls -al nano*

    (Output) -rw-r--r-- 1 root root 172710 Jul 16  2014 nano_2.2.6-3_amd64.rpm
